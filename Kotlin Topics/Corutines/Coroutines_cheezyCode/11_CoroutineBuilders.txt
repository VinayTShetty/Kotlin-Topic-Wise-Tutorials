CoRoutines Builder
CoRoutine Builders are used to create coroutines

There are 3 types of coroutines builders.
1)launch
2)async
3)runBlocking


launch
******
 a)GlobalScope.launch{}
   Its actually a companion Object
   Its remains active untill the application is kept active.
   Ex:-File Downlaod,Music
   Its not recomended to create GlobalScope.launch{} as its more resource consumption.
   So it should be used wisely

 b)launch{}
   Its local co routine
   Once the activity/fragments is destroyed the corresponsing coroutine will be lost.
   Ex:-Some data computation


async
*****
 a)GlobalScope.launch{}
