Co-Routine

1)Doing more intesive task on main thread will crash the applicaion.
2)To alter that if we keep creating background Thread for each and every task,It will lead to "Out of Memory" error

To avoid this we can use co-routine


Like threads coroutines can 
1)Run in parallel
2)wait for each other
3)communicate with each other



Difference between runblocking and GloabalScope.launch.
